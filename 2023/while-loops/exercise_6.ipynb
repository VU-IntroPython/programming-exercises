    "### Task 6: Fibonacci Sequence\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1. Here's how it begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "0 and 1 are the first two numbers in the sequence.\n",
    "The third number is the sum of the first two numbers (0 + 1), which is 1.\n",
    "The fourth number is the sum of the second and third numbers (1 + 1), which is 2.\n",
    "This pattern continues indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you're tasked with creating a Python program that generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit using a while-loop. To achieve this, you'll prompt the user to enter a limit (a maximum value), and then your program will calculate and print the Fibonacci numbers up to that limit."
